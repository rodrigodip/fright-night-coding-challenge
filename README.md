# JetBrain's Fright Night Coding Challenge ðŸŽƒ
A miserable autumn day. Rain and gray skies. Two vacation days that aren't enough for the beach, but enough to visit your old uncle in the middle of nowhere. Wrong turns. A dead GPS. Then â€” a pop, a hiss. Your tire quits...
This is how Day 1 of the Fright Night coding challenge begins â€” a 10-day coding journey starting today through October 31st. One problem per day. Any programming language. Pure fun (and horror ðŸ‘»).
